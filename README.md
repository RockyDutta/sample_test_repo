I am a passionate beginner programmer currently learning and building projects using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
I enjoy creating responsive and interactive web pages while improving my problem-solving skills everyday.
I believe that everyday is new learning for me and learning from my mistakes is a key for me.

FEATURES :-
1.Fully Responsive : Optimized for mobile screens,desktop and tablets.
2.Interactive UI : Uses JS for specific JS feature.
3.Modern Styling : Clean layout built with CSS.

BUILT WITH :-
1. HTML5 : Semantic structure for better accessibility.
2. CSS3 : Custom styling for adding features to the web-page.
3. JS(ES6+) : Build logic for the entire web-page and to be fully functional.

LEARNING EXPERIENCES :-
I believe that starting small and keeping practicing daily not only develops hands-on coding but also builds logic,consistency and learning ideas.
